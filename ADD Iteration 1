1. Architectural Drivers
1.1 Functional Requirements
   - give conversational interface for academic questions(R1, RS1)
   - integrate with LMS, Registration, Calendars (R3)
   - Notify students about the deadlines (RS2)
   - Let lecturers post announcements (RL2)
   - Provide analytics and dashboards (RS3, RL3)
   - Provide SSO authentication (RS7)

1.2 Quality Attributes
   - Performance: Query response < 2 seconds
   - Availability: 99.5% uptime
   - Security: SSO, role-based access
   - Scalability: 5000+ concurrent users
   - Modifiability: Plug-in support for new AI models
   - Usability: Intuitive UI and conversational

1.3 System Constraints
   -Must integrate with university systems that already exist
   -Must use cloud-based deployment
   -Must comply with security policies/ privacy
   -Must use AI for NLP (R5)

1.4 Architectural concerns
   -Protect the sensitive student data
   -Make sure the response time is fast
   -Manage AI model updates
   -Prevent unauthorized access
   -make sure data is consistent across sources

2. Choose the reference architecture
microservices + event-driven + cloud-native
Justification:
  -Independent services support scalability
  -AI processing could be isolated for processing
  -The university system integrations suit microservices API gateways
  -Cloud-native deployment enhances reliability and uptime 
  -Event-driven design supports notifications and alerts

3. Define the Top-level modules

Core components
 1. Conversational interface service
   -Handles voice/chat input-output
 2. NLP/AI Processing service
   -uses AI model for detecting intention and generating a response
 3. User profile & interaction history service
   -stores personalization data
 4. Academic data integration service
   -connects to external systems
 5. Notification engine
   -sends deadlines, announcements, and reminders
 6. Analytics service
   -Dashboards & academic insights
 7. Authentication/SSo Service
   -OAuth / Single sign-on
 8. API gateway
   -Entry point for all requests
 9.Frontend UI ( web + Mobile)
   -The actual interface for users
