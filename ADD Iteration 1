<h3>Quality Attributes</h3>

| Attribute | Scenario | Measure |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Performance** | Student asks a question through chat. | System replies within ≤ 2 seconds (RS10). |
| **Availability** | One server fails during peak hours. | ≥ 99.5% uptime (RA6, RS11). |
| **Security** | User tries to access data without login. | Access denied. Zero data leaks (RS7, RS8, RA5). |
| **Scalability** | 5000 students use the system during exam week. | No lag, stable response time (RA7). |
| **Usability** | A new student completes their first task. | ≤ 1 minute with no help (RS9, RS12). |
| **Interoperability** | Sync calendar data with external applications. | Exports correctly to Google/Outlook (RS13, RD2). |
| **Modifiability** | Maintainer updates AI model. | No downtime (RM1, RM5). |
