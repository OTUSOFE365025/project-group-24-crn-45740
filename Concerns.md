<h1>Architectural Concerns</h1>

- Integration Complexity: The university systems that need to be integrated are numerous, and they all have different schemas and APIs (R3, RD1).
- Data Privacy: Access to the system will be strictly controlled and monitored through audit trails (RS7, RA5).
- Latency: The interaction must be perceived as instantaneous (RS10).
- Scalability: The system will already be prepared to deal with the heavy loads that occur during the exams (RA7).
- Reliability: A backup will be ready for immediate switch over, and data restoration will be possible (RA6, RM6).
- Extensibility: Updating AI models and incorporating new data sources will be among the measures taken to safeguard the system against becoming obsolete (RM3, RM5).
- Observability: The health of the system and the AI's performance will be tracked via dashboards and logs (RM2, RM4).
